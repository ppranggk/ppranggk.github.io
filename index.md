## 📖 About the Project
"Machine-Learning-Should-Warn-Not-Decide" is an essay that explores the role of machine learning (ML) in decision-making. The essay argues that ML can be ineffective when used to automate choices in uncertain situations. Instead, it positions ML as a tool that alerts users to warning signs, enabling them to make better-informed decisions. This work emphasizes the importance of human judgment in an era dominated by digital tools.
